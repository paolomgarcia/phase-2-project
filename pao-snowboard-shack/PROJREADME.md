## Usability

The website will be presented from an admin point of view. The user will be able to run their website with the following capabilities:

1. Seaminglessly navigate through the website's home, about us, and add me page.
2. Add new products as they come in which will persist inside of the database.
3. Remove a product directly from the website if it's potentially sold in-store and needs to be removed from the database.
4. Search for products via model, size, terrain, and brand.
