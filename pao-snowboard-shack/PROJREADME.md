# Pao's Snowboard Shack

## Usability

The website will be presented from an admin point of view. The user will be able to run their website with the following capabilities:

1. Navigate current snowboard availability seaminglessly with the ability to change the amount of products displayed on the page from 10 at a time to 25 or 50 at a time.

2. Add new products as they come in which will persist inside of the database.
3. Remove a product directly from the website if it's potentially sold in-store and needs to be removed from the database.
